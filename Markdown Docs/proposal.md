***Introduction***

The Vulcan Activity Tracker -- Senior Project 2025-2026 is a web-based
application to track PennWest student athletic activities in a fun
interactive environment. This application will combine the features of
recording workouts, viewing performance analysis, and following
leaderboards, with the social aspect of friendly competitions. PennWest
student users will be able to login with their student email to access
many daily fitness tracking amenities. Our project is designed to
service both advanced student athletes that train daily and recreational
fitness users that enjoy participating with friends and clubs.

We aim to utilize several technologies such as a modern interface, a
database, and API connections to build the Vulcan Activity Tracker. Our
goal is to encourage students to maintain a healthy lifestyle through
sports, workouts, and athletic competition. The Vulcan Activity Tracker
will allow students to upload activities they have completed into a
single platform, reducing the workflow of several planner apps and
streamlining daily habits. PennWest students are encouraged to join
their respective teams or club or even create a group with their friends
to view each other's activities. We hope to promote healthy habits,
while bringing the campus together in an athletic community!

***Motivation***

There are many activity tracking applications out there, but most of the
useful features are hidden behind a paywall. Take Strava, for example;
they have an \$80-per-year paywall on their app. This may not be much if
you are a professional athlete or are training for a competition, but if
you are just generally active, it is not worth the price. Our
application will allow PennWest Student users to access some of the
higher-end features without incurring a fee.

We also believe that this could help enhance the community around
campus. Many people play sports, are part of sports clubs, or even just
like to stay active in general, and this application could be a way for
people to connect with others. An example would be running. If you are
not on the track team, there is no real running club on campus, this app
could help you find other people around who also like to run. This could
end up motivating people to stay active by doing activities together or
by making it a fun competition by comparing statistics at the end of
each week.

***Objectives***

1.  Database

    - A working database is crucial in this program as the user will be
      entering activities into the application, and all the details of
      this activity need to be stored accordingly. Not only this, but
      the user will be able to view other people's activities.

2.  Website

    - A web-based application would allow everyone with a PennWest email
      to log in to the application and track their desired activity.

3.  User Friendly Interface

    - Designing the dashboard with a user-friendly approach will promote
      the Vulcan Activity Tracker's use in daily campus life.

4.  Student Interaction

    - Students will be able to make their own personalized groups for
      both campus clubs and friends to track activities, allowing others
      to participate. The Vulcan Activity Tracker will display what
      activities were done as a group and the members involved.

***Implementation Techniques***

*Docker*

Docker is a client-server application to build and run a database
container. This tool creates a blueprint of the database tables and
columns in a cloud-based method to allow for programming group
collaboration and reusability.

*Python-Flask Backend*

The programming language Python will be used as a backend framework for
this web-based application. Flask will be used to integrate with the
Python language and serve as an API framework to streamline server-side
development.

*HTML frontend*

HTML and CSS will be used for our front-end framework of this web-based
application. We will make use of base templates to reduce all the code
to one place and to make routing to another page easier. CSS will be
used for the style of the website.

*API Calls*

We will make use of API calls to enable our front-end features to
connect to our application's back-end. Fetching user and activity
information stored in our database will be possible by creating multiple
API routes. This offers both clarity and organization for development
and usability. API calls will be used to display the information that
the user wants to see based on filters, searches, organizations, etc.

*VS Code*

Visual Studio Code will serve as our code editor for this project. This
development environment allows for complex server and client-side
architecture. Vs Code's vast extensions aid in database debugging,
front-end organization, and API design. Additionally, Vs Code's
git/GitHub integration aids in seamless team collaboration and
development.

***Potential Users***

The potential users of the Vulcan Activity Tracker are PennWest students
that enjoy athletic activities. These activities could be student
athletes that want to track their progress, personal training planning,
and a social aspect of group exercises. By encouraging users to
participate in friendly athletic competitions on campus, the Vulcan
Activity Tracker can promote a healthy and fun campus lifestyle.

***Features***

Leaderboard -- the program will have a leaderboard feature. This will
show the campus leaders in the respective categories, whether it be
miles ran, total time exercising, and many more. Leaderboards can either
be across the entire campus or within the organization/group the user is
in.

Routes -- the program will have a feature that will allow a user to
select the route they took if their activity was outdoors. There will be
a list of available routes along with their mileage. Users can select
how many times they did the route, or if they did a second route within
the activity (an example would be going into the rotary park loop and
then coming back out).
